//! Euclidean zone streaming (#27).
//!
//! The world is **one global map** split into loadable zones. Each zone is
//! authored in its own local (origin-centric) frame but placed in the shared map
//! frame; the host baker (`scene2bin`) derives, from which zones abut, each
//! zone's **boundary connections** — the neighbour, the edge, and the `delta` to
//! add to the avatar's local position when it crosses, so its *global* position
//! is unchanged.
//!
//! At runtime the avatar walks in the current zone's local coords, clamped to
//! its [`Zone::bounds`] (so the tactical map / camera / capture math all stay
//! origin-centric per zone). Reaching a connected edge ([`transition_spaces`])
//! loads the neighbour and adds the connection's `delta` — a continuous step
//! across the seam, no teleport and no direction flip. This replaces the old
//! hand-matched exits + per-edge continuity hacks.
